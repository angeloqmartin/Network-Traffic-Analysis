# Network-Traffic-Analysis

<h1>Network Traffic Analysis Workflow</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The initial step involves connecting to a virtual private network (VPN) to begin network traffic analysis. This connection facilitates access to a live Virtual Machine (VM) host, enabling access to a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Through this setup, the goal is to use Wireshark, a deep and comprehensive analysis tool, within the environment to extract meaningful insights, actionable information, and suspicious traffic from the network traffic data.
